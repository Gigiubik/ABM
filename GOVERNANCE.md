# Mesa Governance
(adopted from OSS Watch - http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel )

## Overview

Mesa is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community,
contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that
participation takes place.

## Roles And Responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community and
without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

The project asks its users to participate in the project and community as much as possible. User contributions enable
the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user contributions include (but are
not limited to):

* evangelising about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
* informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
* providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
* providing financial support (the software is open source, but its developers need to eat)
* Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often become more and more involved. Such users
may find themselves becoming contributors, as described in the next section.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and
contributions can take many forms from code to administration. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no
specific skill requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users)
* reporting bugs
* identifying requirements
* providing graphics and web design
* programming
* assisting with project infrastructure
* writing documentation
* fixing bugs
* adding features

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker, discussion board, discussion forum or by writing or
editing documentation. They submit changes to the project itself via pull requests and [following the contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst), which will be considered for inclusion in
the project by existing committers (see next section). The  discussion forum or a pull request are the best ways to ask
for help when making that first contribution.

All contributors have the right to expect:

* A considerate, positive and thankful assessment of the contribution (without contributors Mesa is unsustainable and
Mesa is committed to helping individuals increase their technical skills)
* A response within 7 days. If you do not see a response, please send us a note on our [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#project-mesa:matrix.org)
* A clear list or description of what is necessary for the code to be merged (as much possible)
* If a pull request is not merged after two rounds of substantive feedback from one committer and new committer will
volunteer to review and help  the pull request be merged. THis is for substantive feedback and not administrative
feedback such as Ruff errors.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within, and commitment to, the community
will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated for committership.

### Committers

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project
through ongoing engagement with the community. Committership allows committers to review other pull requests and merge
them. Committers cannot merge their own code, they must have a 2nd person review their code.

Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to
participate in the project as a team player. Typically, a potential committer will need to show that they have an
understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also have provided valuable contributions to
the project over a period of time.

Committers are expected to:

* Provide positive feedback to contributors (they are volunteers), this can include but is not limited to thank you,
compliments.
* Provide a clear and concise description of those elements that will allow the pull request to me merged
* Mentorship as needed
* Finding a new committer to review the pull request if two rounds of substantive feedback, still needs substantive
feedback.

New committers can be nominated by any existing committer. Once they have been nominated, there will be a vote by the
project management committee (PMC; see below). Committer voting is one of the few activities that takes place on the
project’s private management list. This is to allow PMC members to freely express their opinions about a nominee without
causing embarrassment. Once the vote has been held, the aggregated voting results are published on the public mailing
list. The nominee is entitled to request an explanation of any ‘no’ votes against them, regardless of the outcome of the
vote. This explanation will be provided by the PMC Chair (see below) and will be anonymous and constructive in nature.

Nominees may decline their appointment as a committer. However, this is unusual, as the project does not expect any
specific time or resource commitment from its community members. The intention behind the role of committer is to allow
people to contribute to the project more easily, not to tie them in to the project in any formal way.

It is important to recognise that commitership is a privilege, not a right. That privilege must be earned and once earned
it can be removed by the PMC (see next section) in extreme circumstances. However, under normal circumstances committership
exists for as long as the committer wishes to continue engaging with the project.

A committer who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project, particularly with respect to its strategic
direction and long-term health, may be nominated to become a member of the PMC. This role is described below.

### Project management committee

The project management committee consists of those individuals identified as ‘project owners’ on the development site.
The PMC has additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth
running of the project. PMC members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning,
approve changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs.

Members of the PMC do not have significant authority over other members of the community, although it is the PMC that
votes on new committers. It also makes decisions when community consensus cannot be reached.

Membership of the PMC is by invitation from the existing PMC members. A nomination will result in discussion and then a
vote by the existing PMC members. PMC membership votes are subject to consensus approval of the current PMC members.

### PMC Chair

The PMC Chair is a single individual, voted for by the PMC members. Once someone has been appointed Chair, they remain
in that role until they choose to retire, or the PMC casts a two-thirds majority vote to remove them.

The PMC Chair has no additional authority over other members of the PMC: the role is one of coordinator and facilitator.
The Chair is also expected to ensure that all governance processes are adhered to, and has the casting vote when the
project fails to reach consensus.
