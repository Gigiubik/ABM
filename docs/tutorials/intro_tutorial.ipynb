    "## Tutorial Description\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).  Getting started with Mesa is easy. In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a simple model and progressively add functionality which will illustrate Mesa's core features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This tutorial is a work-in-progress. If you find any errors or bugs, or just find something unclear or confusing, [let us know](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The base for this tutorial is a very simple model of agents exchanging money. Next, we add *space* to allow agents to move. Then, we'll cover two of Mesa's analytic tools: the *data collector* and *batch runner*. After that, we'll add an *interactive visualization* which lets us watch the model as it runs. Finally, we go over how to write your own visualization module, for users who are comfortable with JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find all the code this tutorial describes in the **examples/boltzmann_wealth_model** directory of the Mesa repository."

    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent-based economy, drawn from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to wealth distribution [Dragulescu2002]. The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin with 1 unit of money.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent gives 1 unit of money (if they have it) to some other agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it. For our purposes, it also easily demonstrates Mesa's core features.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, install Mesa. We recommend doing this in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), but make sure your environment is set up with Python 3. Mesa requires Python3 and does not work in Python 2 environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Mesa, simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip install --upgrade mesa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do that, it will install Mesa itself, as well as any dependencies that aren't in your setup yet. Additional dependencies required by this tutorial can be found in the **examples/boltzmann_wealth_model/requirements.txt** file, which can be installed directly form the github repository by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip install --upgrade -r https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/blob/main/examples/boltzmann_wealth_model_network/requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file which are:  \n",
    "- mesa (this ABM library -- if not installed)\n",
    "- jupyter (Ipython interactive notebook)\n",
    "- matplotlib (Python's visualization library)\n",

    "## Building a sample model\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Mesa is installed, you can start building our model. You can write models in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the code in its own file with your favorite text editor, or\n",
    "2. Write the model interactively in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, it's good practice to put your model in its own folder -- especially if the project will end up consisting of multiple files (for example, Python files for the model and the visualization, a Notebook for analysis, and a Readme with some documentation and discussion).\n",

    "### Setting up the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin writing the model code, we start with two core classes: one for the overall model, the other for the agents. The model class holds the model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent classes are child classes of Mesa's generic `Model` and `Agent` classes. This is seen in the code with `class MoneyModel(mesa.Model)` or `class MoneyAgent(mesa.Agent)`. If you want you can specifically the class being imported by looking at the [model](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/model.py) or [agent](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/agent.py) code in the mesa repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent has only one variable: how much wealth it currently has. (Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a name), stored in the `unique_id` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good practice when doing agent-based modeling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one model-level parameter: how many agents the model contains. When a new model is started, we want it to populate itself with the given number of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of both classes looks like this:"

    "### Adding the scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "Time in most agent-based models moves in steps, sometimes also called **ticks**. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scheduler** is a special model component which controls the order in which agents are activated. For example, all the agents may activate in the same order every step; their order might be shuffled; we may try to simulate all the agents acting at the same time; and more. Mesa offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior. This may not seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your results [Comer2014].\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's use one of the simplest ones: `RandomActivation`*, which activates all the agents once per step, in random order. Every agent is expected to have a ``step`` method. The step method is the action the agent takes when it is activated by the model schedule. We add an agent to the schedule using the `add` method; when we call the schedule's `step` method, the model shuffles the order of the agents, then activates and executes each agent's ```step``` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Unlike `mesa.model` or `mesa.agent`, `mesa.time` has multiple classes (e.g. `RandomActivation`, `StagedActivation` etc). To ensure context, time is used in the import as evidenced below with `mesa.time.Randomactivation`.  You can see the different time classes as [mesa.time](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/time.py). \n",

Grids are divided into cells, and agents can only be on a particular cell, like pieces on a chess board. Continuous space, in contrast, allows agents to have any arbitrary position. Both grids and continuous spaces are frequently [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_graph), meaning that the edges wrap around, with cells on the right edge connected to those on the left edge, and the top to the bottom. This prevents some cells having fewer neighbors than others, or agents being able to go off the edge of the environment.\n",

If we wanted to know the wealth of each agent at each step, we'd have to add that to the loop of executing steps, and figure out some way to store the data.\n",

    "The data collector stores three categories of data: model-level variables, agent-level variables, and tables (which are a catch-all for everything else). Model- and agent-level variables are added to the data collector along with a function for collecting them. Model-level collection functions take a model object as an input, while agent-level collection functions take an agent object as an input. Both then return a value computed from the model or each agent at their current state. When the data collector’s `collect` method is called, with a model object as its argument, it applies each model-level collection function to the model, and stores the results in a dictionary, associating the current value with the current step of the model. Similarly, the method applies each agent-level collection function to each agent currently in the schedule, associating the resulting value with the step of the model, and the agent’s `unique_id`.\n",

At the agent level, we want to collect every agent's wealth at every step.
