# Example Code

This directory contains example models meant to test and demonstrate Mesa's features, and provide demonstrations for how to build and analyze agent-based models. For more information on each model, see its own Readme and documentation.

### Color Patches
A cellular automaton model where agents opinions are influenced by that of their neighbors. As the model evolves, color patches representing the prevailing opinion in a given area expand, contract, and sometimes disappear.

### Conway's Game Of Life
An implementation of the Famous Pr. Conway's Game Of Life

### Epstein Civil Violence Model
Joshua Epstein's [model](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2002/epstein2002a.pdf) of how a decentralized uprising can be suppressed or reach a critical mass of support.

### Flockers
Boids-style flocking model, demonstrating the use of agents moving through a continuous space following direction vectors.

### Forest Fire Spread
Simple cellular automata of a fire spreading through a forest of cells on a grid.

### Prisoner's Dilemna on a Grid
Grid-based demographic prisoner's dilemma model, demonstrating how simple mimicing can lead to the emergence of widespread cooperation -- and how a model activation regime can change its outcome.

### Schelling Segregation Model
Simple implementation of the classic Schelling segregation model.

### Tutorial Bolzmann Wealth Model
Simple agent-based model, drawn from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to wealth distribution [Dragulescu and Yakovenko](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0211175v1.pdf)
(Tutorial is in a Jupyter notebook)

### Wolf Sheep Predation
Implementation of a simple ecological predator Prey and Reproduction Simulation.
